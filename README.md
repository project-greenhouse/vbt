# VBT Coaches Tool



Welcome to our Velocity Based Training (VBT) web app, designed for strength coaches and trainers who want to improve their athletes' performance. Our Shiny web app allows you to upload your own VBT data for analysis, providing you with key metrics and insights to help you create effective training plans.

With our app, you can access four dashboards that cater to different aspects of VBT analysis. The Historical Review dashboard shows you a chronological view of data for the selected athlete and exercise. This dashboard has three graphs and four tables that help you track an athlete's progress over time. The Session Comparison dashboard enables you to compare two load-velocity profiles against each other, providing you with key calculated outputs for each session. The Training Planner dashboard allows you to filter a specific training session by exercise, athlete, and date, to gain specific training targets for that athlete based on the data collected. Finally, the Team Table dashboard shows you all athletes' training data on a particular date.

Each dashboard provides comprehensive data analysis that can help you identify an athlete's strengths and weaknesses, monitor progress, and develop personalized training plans. Our app's user-friendly interface and easy-to-use features make it an ideal tool for coaches and trainers, regardless of their experience with VBT.
